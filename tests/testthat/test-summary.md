# Comprehensive Test Suite Summary for neuroatlas

## New Diagnostic Tests Added

### 1. Surface Atlas Tests (`test-surface-atlases.R`)
**Purpose**: Ensure surface-based atlases maintain hemisphere integrity and handle all surface types correctly

**Key Tests**:
- Surface atlas structure validation
- Hemisphere ID mapping (left: 1-100, right: 101-200)
- Different surface types (inflated, white, pial) consistency
- Label consistency across hemispheres
- Network distribution validation
- Network preservation during operations
- Color map handling across atlas types

**Diagnostic Value**: 
- Catches hemisphere mapping errors that could corrupt analyses
- Ensures network assignments are balanced and preserved
- Validates color maps for visualization integrity

### 2. TemplateFlow Advanced Tests (`test-templateflow-advanced.R`)
**Purpose**: Test edge cases and advanced features of TemplateFlow integration

**Key Tests**:
- Cache management functionality
- Vectorized template fetching (multiple resolutions/variants)
- Surface template retrieval
- Error handling for invalid spaces
- Memoization performance verification
- Convenience function (sy_*) validation
- Print method output verification

**Diagnostic Value**:
- Ensures caching works correctly to avoid redundant downloads
- Validates complex parameter combinations
- Confirms performance optimizations are working

### 3. Data Integrity Tests (`test-data-integrity.R`)
**Purpose**: Verify pre-loaded datasets and critical helper functions

**Key Tests**:
- Pre-loaded Schaefer datasets structure (Schaefer17_200/400/600)
- fsaverage surface data integrity
- olsen_mtl MTL atlas validation
- Helper function testing (getmode, cache directory)
- Edge case handling (empty data, uniform values, extreme values)
- Label parsing validation

**Diagnostic Value**:
- Ensures shipped data is not corrupted
- Validates critical internal functions
- Tests extreme cases that could cause silent failures

## Critical Functionality Now Tested

### 1. **Hemisphere Integrity**
- ID remapping between hemispheres
- Consistent hemisphere distribution
- Cross-hemisphere operations

### 2. **Network Functionality**
- Network preservation during resampling
- Network-based data reduction
- Network balance across hemispheres

### 3. **Data Robustness**
- Handling of Inf, -Inf, NA, NaN values
- Empty data processing
- Uniform value datasets
- Extreme resampling parameters

### 4. **Atlas Operations**
- Color map preservation during merge
- Label consistency after operations
- Multi-atlas compatibility

### 5. **Performance**
- Memoization effectiveness
- Cache hit rates
- Vectorized operation efficiency

## Test Coverage Summary

**Total New Tests**: ~50+ test assertions across 3 test files

**Key Areas Covered**:
1. Surface atlas functionality (previously untested)
2. Network-specific operations (previously untested)
3. Color map handling (previously untested)
4. Pre-loaded dataset integrity (previously untested)
5. TemplateFlow advanced features (partially tested before)
6. Edge cases in core operations (enhanced coverage)

## Benefits of These Tests

1. **Early Detection**: Catches subtle bugs that could corrupt neuroimaging analyses
2. **Regression Prevention**: Ensures future changes don't break critical functionality
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Validates caching and memoization work correctly
4. **Data Integrity**: Confirms pre-loaded data remains consistent
5. **Network Analysis**: Ensures network-based analyses are reliable
6. **Visualization**: Validates color mapping for accurate brain visualizations

## Remaining Considerations

1. Some tests require network access (TemplateFlow downloads)
2. Surface atlas tests depend on neurosurf package functionality
3. Large atlas operations may be slow in testing environments
4. Some edge cases may be platform-dependent

These diagnostic tests significantly enhance confidence in the package's reliability and catch issues that could lead to incorrect scientific results.
