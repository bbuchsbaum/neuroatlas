\usage{
clear_templateflow_cache(confirm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{confirm}{Logical. If `TRUE` (the default), the function will ask for
interactive confirmation before deleting files if the session is interactive.
If `FALSE`, or if the session is not interactive, deletion will proceed without confirmation.}
}
\value{

  and `FALSE` if the operation was aborted by the user during confirmation.
}
\description{
Removes all files and subdirectories from the `neuroatlas` package's cache
directory used for TemplateFlow downloads. This function also clears the
in-memory memoisation cache for TemplateFlow path lookups.
}
\details{
The TemplateFlow cache directory is typically located within the path returned by
`tools::R_user_dir("neuroatlas", "cache")`, in a subdirectory named "templateflow".
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Clear the TemplateFlow cache (will ask for confirmation if interactive)
