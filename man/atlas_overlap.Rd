\title{Cross-Atlas Overlap Analysis}
\usage{
atlas_overlap(atlas1, atlas2, metrics = c("dice", "jaccard"), min_overlap = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{atlas1}{An atlas object (with \code{$atlas}, \code{$ids}, \code{$labels}).}

\item{atlas2}{An atlas object (with \code{$atlas}, \code{$ids}, \code{$labels}).}

\item{metrics}{Character vector of overlap metrics to compute. One or more of
\code{"dice"} and \code{"jaccard"}. Default is both.}

\item{min_overlap}{Integer. Minimum number of overlapping voxels for a pair
to be included in the results. Default is 0 (include all pairs with any
overlap).}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{atlas1_id}{Integer region ID from \code{atlas1}}
    \item{atlas1_label}{Character label from \code{atlas1}}
    \item{atlas2_id}{Integer region ID from \code{atlas2}}
    \item{atlas2_label}{Character label from \code{atlas2}}
    \item{dice}{Dice similarity coefficient (if requested)}
    \item{jaccard}{Jaccard similarity coefficient (if requested)}
    \item{n_overlap}{Number of overlapping voxels}
    \item{n_atlas1}{Total voxels in the \code{atlas1} region}
    \item{n_atlas2}{Total voxels in the \code{atlas2} region}
  }
  Rows are sorted by Dice coefficient descending (or Jaccard if Dice was not
  requested).
}
\description{
Computes spatial overlap between regions of two atlases using Dice and/or
Jaccard similarity coefficients. This is useful for comparing parcellations,
assessing correspondence between atlases, or mapping regions from one atlas
to another.
