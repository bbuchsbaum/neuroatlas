# Schaefer ggseg_atlas data objects (Schaefer17_200, Schaefer17_400,
# Schaefer17_600) have been removed as of v0.2.0.
#
# These were ggseg-format atlas objects only useful with the ggseg
# visualisation pipeline, which has been replaced by plot_brain().
#
# Use schaefer_surf() + plot_brain() for surface visualisation, or
# get_schaefer_atlas() for volumetric atlas access.
